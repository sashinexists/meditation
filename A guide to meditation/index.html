				<h3>What is meditation?</h3>
				<p>Meditation is a method of training the mind to rest its attention on the present moment. We live our lives perpetually buffetted by memories of the past and anticipation for the future. The mind is always trying to get to a certain place or have a certain experience.</p>
				<p>We may think we have many different desires and ambitions but all of them amount to one thing. We believe that if only we could acheive or attain them, we would finally have reason to just be happy in the present. In striving toward our envisioned future we overlook the one place where we could possibly find real happiness, here and now.</p>
				<p>Life is here and now, it's happening at this moment. Like a candle that burns, life is being used up as you live it, getting shorter and shorter with every passing second. We tend to live as if life hasn't begun, that the purpose in this moment is to prepare for a future moment. We postpone living our lives, and this can go on indefinitely.</p>
				<p>There are probably a number of things you are doing, or plan on doing to improve your life. These might include:</p> 
				<ul>
				<li>Getting in shape</li>
				<li>Learning a skill</li>
				<li>Engaging in studies</li>
				<li>Planning on getting married</li>
				<li>Having children</li>
				<li>Getting rich</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				In each of these activities there is the implicit promise that if only you could do them you would become happy. But no matter what "happily ever after" you think you've experienced there is always the day after the happily ever after. Life will go back to normal, and you will find yourself back in the same scenario, still striving towards happiness. What if there was another way? Instead of trying to escape ordinary life, what if there was a way of finding lasting happiness in the midst of it?</p>
				<p>Meditation is a means of breaking this cycle of continually hoping to be happy in the future but never quite getting there. It is a way of finding out that what you were looking for, was right in front of you the whole time. Happiness is here and now.</p>

				<h3>Mindfulness: The grand panacea</h3>
				<p>There isn't one universal method to meditation. There are many different techniques and a number of them will be covered through this course. Let's start with the quintessence of all meditation practice: Mindfulness.</p>
				<p>Life is suffering. This is well known as the first of the four noble truths of buddhism. Only thing, it's wrong. The word the buddha used was the pali word "dukkha". Suffering is an approximate translation of the word dukkha. A better translation would be "unsatisfactoriness". Life isn't bad per se, it simply isn't enough.</p>
				<p>This isn't a problem with the world. It's a problem with the mind. It's not that the world is somehow fundamentally lacking, rather it's that the mind always wants more.</p>
				<p>Fortunately, there is a cure prescribed to the unsatisfactoriness. This cure is known in pali as "Sati" commonly translated to English as mindfulness.</p>
				<p>Mindfulness is a clear, nonjudgemental and undistracted attention to what is in the present moment of experience. Most studies on the benefits of meditation have been conducted using techniques that revolve around the cultivating of this quality.</p>

				<h3>Meditation instructions: Basic Shamata</h3>
				<p>Shamata is the quintessence of meditation. It is common to most schools of buddhism and translates roughly to "Stilling the mind" or "Calm abidance". It's goal is to generate a state of quiet calm, peace and tranquility. Once the mind is quiet then deeper forms of meditation can take place but until then shamata is a necessary base practice.</p>
				<p>Like many forms of meditation shamata is a means to develop mindfulness and settle the mind in the present. The anchor to the present in this practice is the breath. The breath is happening right now. When attention is on the breath it is not in the past or the future, it is here and now. The key to this practice is the place the attention gently on the breath and simply observe it how it happens. You aren't anticipating the future breaths or holding on the past breaths or waiting for the meditation to get good. You are simply to be.</p>
				<p>Instructions for shamata are really simple. All you have to do is.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Sit down on a chair or cross legged on a cushion, making sure that your back is straight</li>
					<li>Gently become aware of your breathing, of the air going in and out of your nose or mouth</li>
					<li>When you get distracted by your thoughts, gently bring your attention back to the breath</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Try to make this your daily practice. Every day for five to ten minutes, practice shamata.</p>
